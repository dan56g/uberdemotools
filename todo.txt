To do:
* DLL: Use FatalError on all the real fatal errors (done for virtual memory allocation)
* Stats analyzer: support for all known scores/stats commands
- A "Search" tab for finding demos matching certain criteria? (players, maps, modes, protocol, etc)
- Player position smoothing for "laggy" demos
- DLL: Better mid-air detection heuristics?
- DLL: Give plug-ins the ability to tell when their job is done so that parsing can be stopped early
- Frag Sequence cut filter: add a "max. time after spawn" option to detect sequences of spawnfrags
- Frag Sequence cut filter: add a "all kills vs the same player" option?
- Auto-rename functionality (read the first game-state message and rename the demo using the info extracted)
- Merger: Find a way to solve the "item problem"
- Merger: Find a way to deal with the "player entities event sequence problem"
- Time shifter: Finer granularity level? Give the offset in milliseconds or floating-point snapshot count?
- Converters: dm_73/dm_90 -> dm_91 once dm_91 becomes the new standard
- UDT_json: split the work into smaller batches
- UDT_cutter: split the work into smaller batches
- UDT_cutter: optional gamestate index argument (default: 0)
- Track overtime start/end times to be able to translate all match times to server times
- More reliable overtime detection?
