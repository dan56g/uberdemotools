To do:
- Player position smoothing for "laggy" demos
- DLL: Better mid-air detection heuristics?
- DLL: Give plug-ins the ability to tell when their job is done so that parsing can be stopped early
- Frag Sequence cut filter: add a "max. time after spawn" option to detect sequences of spawnfrags
- Frag Sequence cut filter: add a "all kills vs the same player" option?
- Auto-rename functionality (quicker but less correct version: read the first game-state message only)
- Merger: Find a way to solve the "item problem"
- Merger: Find a way to deal with the "player entities event sequence problem"
- Time shifter: Finer granularity level? Give the offset in milliseconds or floating-point snapshot count?
- Track overtime start/end times to be able to translate all match times to server times
- More reliable overtime detection?
